In this sub-repository, we provide a set of supervised evaluation scripts for imaging metrics such as `MAE`, `PSNR`, `SSIM2D`, and `SSIM3D`. These can be used by specifying the file paths for the real and generated images.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the generated images in a supervised manner, run the following command:

```
python ./evaluation_metrics.py \
  --out_results_dir ./ \              # Output directory for the results
  --methodname GenPET \               # Specify the subdirectory of the generated images
  --data_range 2.6 \                  # Specify the PSNR range for the modality
  --window_size 11 \                  # Specify the SSIM window size
  --real_image_path your_real_image_path \  # Path to the real image
  --generated_image_path your_generated_image_path  # Path to the generated image
```

**Note**: We do not use `PSNR` as the evaluation metric in this case, because voxel intensities for tracer-specific PET images can vary, and using a unified `data_range` may not fully capture the differences across different tracers.
